/**
 * scripts/electron-after-sign.cjs
 *
 * electron-builder `afterSign` hook. Runs after the app bundle is
 * staged but before the .dmg is built. Two branches live here:
 *
 *   • Developer ID signing (env GETIT_MAC_SIGNING_MODE=developer-id*)
 *     — `scripts/build-electron.mjs` detected a "Developer ID
 *     Application" cert in the keychain and passed flags to
 *     electron-builder so it signs every Mach-O with the cert (and,
 *     when `mode=developer-id`, sends the bundle to Apple's notary
 *     service and staples the ticket onto the .app). The afterSign
 *     hook **does nothing in this branch** — overwriting the
 *     Developer-ID signature with `codesign --sign -` would replace
 *     a trusted signature with an ad-hoc one and break Gatekeeper /
 *     notarization. We only verify the signature is still good.
 *
 *   • Ad-hoc fallback (no Developer ID cert detected, or
 *     `CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false`) — same old behaviour: we
 *     run `codesign --sign -` over every Mach-O so the Apple Silicon
 *     kernel's mandatory-signature check passes (without this, M-
 *     series Macs report a fresh download as "damaged" rather than
 *     showing the bypassable Gatekeeper prompt). The first launch
 *     still requires a one-time System Settings → Privacy & Security
 *     → Open Anyway dance — a Developer-ID + notarize combination
 *     removes that prompt entirely.
 *
 * No-op on Windows / Linux (electron-builder calls afterSign on every
 * target with `electronPlatformName` set accordingly).
